This project is used to record project tasks and their statuses. A database was used here to record all the information. The tasks are displayed using the Kanban board, first mentioned in Japan by Toyota. Their opinion is that this is a convenient location of tasks and their level of performance. There is authorization for logging in with roles and different types of access implemented using JavaScript For demonstration I will attach some screenshots to you.
